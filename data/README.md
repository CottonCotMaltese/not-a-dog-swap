# DNA Data Status (as of 25th June 2025)

This folder contains Excel files representing the DNA profiles involved in the verification process.

## Current Situation

- I was able to **download the mother's DNA profile** from Orivet’s website **over a week ago**.
- Since then, the **download button for DNA profile Excel files** on their website **has stopped working**.
- I am **still waiting for the offspring’s DNA profile result** to become available.

> **Note:** <span style="color: red">**For now, I have temporarily created placeholder files for `Father.xlsx` and `Offspring.xlsx` by duplicating the Mother's DNA profile, for testing and pipeline setup only.**</span>
