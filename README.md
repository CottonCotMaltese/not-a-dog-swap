# not-a-dog-swap
If you're going to accuse me, bring receipts. This repo is mine. The dogs are too. Let’s talk facts.

They accused me of switching dogs for DNA testing.  
So I built a workflow they can’t question — and made it public.

This repository contains *screen-recorded*, *verifiable*, and *version-controlled* evidence of the DNA testing process for my dog. Every step, every file, every command — right here.

## > What This Is

- [x] Full DNA testing workflow, from data download to verification  
- [x] Screen recordings of the entire process (unedited)  
- [x] Scripts, tools, and references used for analysis  
- [x] A public audit trail — because silence isn’t always golden

## > What This Is Not

- [ ] A space for speculation  
- [ ] A place to argue feelings over facts  
- [ ] A cover-up — I don’t do those

## > Why I Did This

Because integrity doesn’t flinch under scrutiny.  
If you’re going to question my dogs, you’d better be ready to read logs.

## > Final Word

This isn’t for applause.  
It’s for accountability.

If you’ve got doubts, clone the repo — not the narrative.
